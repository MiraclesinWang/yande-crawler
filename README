This is a development version of `yande-crawler` project.

Usage:
1. make sure that you have all require modules installed.
2. make sure that you can access https://yande.re in your terminal.
2. in main.py, set which tags and how many pages you want to download.
3. run `python main.py` and wait.
4. images downloaded will be found in . or the path you set(recommended)

Development log:
 - 2021/11/25
    * use API instead of parsing HTML
    * add tqdm to indicate download progress
 - 2021/12/29
    * add multi-processing to accelerate the downloading
    * automatically allocate filename by index, this can organize the files orderly
    * automatically judge how many pictures need to be downloaded, you can also fix the number on your own, but make sure not exceeding the max available number
    * add retrying mechanism, if some images' downloadings fail (quite normal since server and web or vpn are not stable), the code can retry them afterwards.
